# JSON
* JSON, short for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is often used for transmitting data in web applications and for configuration files. It uses a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. This makes JSON an ideal data-interchange language.
